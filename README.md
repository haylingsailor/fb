# Flashpack Code exercise

## Prerequisites

These tests are written in Go and require Go 1.12 or later to run.

To install Go, follow [these instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once installed and verified, clone [haylingsailor/fd](https://github.com/haylingsailor/fb).

## Running tests, building and running the exercises

The `cmd` folder contains the 3 exercises as separate binaries. For each, the implementation is in `main.go` and the tests in `main_test.go`.

Assuming you're using a bash commandline, from the root folder of the repo,

Run all the tests in all the exercises with: `go test ./...`.

To build and run a specific test (e.g. `exercise1`):

- Descend to the `exercise1` directory
- Do `go test` to see the output of the test.
- Do `go build && ./exercise1` to build and run the executable.
